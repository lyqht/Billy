# Contributing

## Introduction 

Hello there! Thanks for considering to contribute to Billy 🧡

Billy is still **very early in the development phase** (refer to [ROADMAP](./docs/roadmap.md)).

As such, the project is not open for public contributions to the **mobile app codebase**. However, there are areas that you can contribute in if you find the project worthy of your investment. Read the [ground rules](#️-ground-rules) first before looking at what you can contribute tho!

## ⚠️ Ground rules

### Keeping GitHub a safe environment

This is an open source project. Do not harrass people for replies.

### Contributing guidelines

Please open an issue first to discuss what you want to be done before implementing anything. This is to keep contributions aligned with the product roadmap and vision. In the issue, please provide sufficient mockups/ screenshots/ flow diagrams whenever applicable.

- Bug and feature request issues are only prioritised if they are raised by **testers**. To be a Billy tester, please read the [section on what you can contribute in](#what-you-can-contribute-in).
- PRs not linked to any issues will **not** be entertained, and **auto-closed after 3 days**.


## What you can contribute in

- **Be a Billy tester!**
  > I've only managed to set up deployment for android, so if you're on iOS, you can still participate as a tester but you need to install the app locally by cloning the project & setting it up.
  - Fill up [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jP9VCxjpFBRRw_SALLVOkBdoSCMZcnvOLw6zbZSyovs/edit) if you're keen to help to try out the app. 
- **A product landing website**
  - it should display all the information that is already in the /docs folder.
  - it should have a form for users to request for data retrieval or removal
- **Improved documentation**
  - Spellings, rephrasing (for the better) are welcome.
  - If you have tried to setup Billy on your own and you find a gap in the setup instructions, feel free to add onto it.
  - Mermaid diagrams of how the tech side of things works
  - User journey diagrams of how users can use Billy
- **GitHub Issue templates**
  - feel free to add templates for the community to contribute to Billy more easily
- **GitHub Actions**
  - There's E2E tests for Billy, but I haven't integrated it as part of the CICD yet. If you can help to create a workflow that runs the tests & save failing screenshots as artifacts, that will be great.
