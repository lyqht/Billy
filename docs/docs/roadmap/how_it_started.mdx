# How it started

## Motivations for building the app

I had built Billy intended for these few specific target audiences:
- Less tech-savvy users like my mom, who are **only-mobile users**, and prefer having **specific apps for specific functionalities**. They would benefit heavily from native notifications to keep track of their bills.
- Techies like me who are less organized, but has a ton of subscriptions to remember to manage and pay on time. Many times, I also **don't want to automatically renew these subscriptions** if I don't use them much during the trial period. 

My mom & I both like cute stuff, so that's how _Billy_ has its name.

## Mock ups

### Base mockup

Yes it looks a lot different from then! The original figma mockup is made using Native Base's Figma kit â€” and now I'm not even using Native Base component library. This mockup gave me sufficient ideas on what I want to display that I didn't feel a need to create a new one.

### Analytics Mockup

User can select a date range, and filters such as 'show upcoming bills', 'show missed bills' and categories of bills to be displayed. Charts will be displayed based on user inputs. There will also be a lifetime statistics containing the number of bills completed & the number of reminder notifications sent out to remind the user.](/img/diagrams/analytics_mockups.png)

## Content Models

These are some brief ideations of the content models and entities that could be in Billy. Billy still has a long way to go \m/ although probably not everything would be in v1.0.0 of production release.
