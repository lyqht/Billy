## Motivations for building the app

I had built Billy intended for these few specific target audiences:
- Less tech-savvy users like my mom, who are **only-mobile users**, and prefer having **specific apps for specific functionalities**. They would benefit heavily from native notifications to keep track of their bills.
- Techies like me who are less organized, but has a ton of subscriptions to remember to manage and pay on time. Many times, I also **don't want to automatically renew these subscriptions** if I don't use them much during the trial period. 

My mom & I both like cute stuff, so that's how _Billy_ has its name.
